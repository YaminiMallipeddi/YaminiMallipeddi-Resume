        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Undergraduate, Pre Business student at the University of California, Riverside. Developed communication and marketing through club involvement at school. Represented as Head publicist, Vice President, and President during different periods of highschool for a club called Stylites. Stylites is a anti trafficking club that fundraises for victims of human trafficking. Throughout my year as publicist for the club, Stylites, I was obligated to market and fundraise the club on various social media platforms. I fundraised around $800 on one Instagram event where we thrifted, bought, donated clothes. Then we modeled the clothes on students. After posting these pictures and rasing a certain amount of money, we would donate the money to a larger anti human trafficking orginization. The organization we commonly donated to was Polaris. As Vice President, I was obligated to keep track of the presentations during club meetings and make sure board members were playing their parts in order to maintain a functioning and well rounded club. As president, I took care of most of the finances, especially regarding turning in receipts and financial information to the asb office. This position also required me to elect new members for the board and prepare for next year's board members. I was also in charge of setting events and coming up with topics to talk about and present to the club every Thursday during the club meeting days. I was also a member of the Key Club. Key Club is a national volunteering club that requires us to help out in different locations and partake in some sort of community service for a specific number of hours. I was a member of this club for three out of the fours years I was attending West Torrance High School. I spent most of my time volunteering at the elementary school close by. This elementary school is called Victor Elementary School and here, I helped teachers grade papers for their students, clean their classrooms, prepare gradebooks and agendas, and organize desks and shelves. I really enjoyed this community service because as a young kid, I always wanted to be a teacher. Along with that, I have also always been heavily involved in community service and volunteer work since my parents have always ingrained that into my lifestyle. Along with volunteering at Victor Elementary School, I also volunteered at community gardens and beach clean ups for Key Club and their services. <br><br> 
        
        With my family we have volunteered at multiple shelters. One of the most memorable events I can remember was the time we made over two hundred sandwiches for the homeless, then drove through the city of Los Angeles passing the sandwiches out to the homeless. My parents' friends also drove by skid-row, a very infamous area where homeless people are lined up and crowding the entire area. <br><br>
        
        Along with this, to build onto my communication, marketing, and public speaking skills, I have personally partook in a program called Teen Talk. Teen Talk is an online broadcasting show where teens can come on and talk about some of their achievements, what makes them special, and even some of the hardships we might go through as a teen. As I am eighteen, I am the oldest member on Teen Talk and can provide an additional and new perspective to the show when compared to the other members. These shows are then presented on Television through Spring Nectar TV.
